    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        <strong><em>This is an adaptation of the Chainbaker's brownie recipe to fit a 9x13 pan, and I am not a baker. Follow at your own risk.</em></strong>

    <p>   
        It makes simple, delicious, choclatey brownies. These are not diet food by any means but are easy and quick to make.
        I prefer them cold, as they get a gooey, almost fudge like center while keeping the satisfying crunch of good bread 
        elsewhere. I'd recommend chilling them overnight, but 2 to 3 hours should suffice. It is very important to let them 
        cool completely before attempting to remove from the pan as the internals of the brownie is essentially a liquid 
        straight out of the oven.

    <h5>Servings: 1 9x13 pan</h5>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>400g sugar</li>
        <li>200g flour</li>
        <li>12 oz (340g) bittersweet or semisweet chocolate chips</li>
        <li>12 oz (3 sticks) of salted butter</li>
        <li>5 large eggs at room temp</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
        <li>Pre-heat oven to 350 Farenheight</li>
        <li>Thouroughly mix eggs and sugar until smooth (4 to 5 minutes by hand or 2 to 3 on medium with a hand mixer). if there are lumps remve them by passing the mixture through a sieve.</li>
        <li>Mix the flour with the eggs/sugar until smooth batter forms. </li>
        <li>Melt the chocolate and butter in a medium saucepan on medium heat, stirring consistently, until both are melted and combined. This mixture does not need to get hot, just melted.</li>
        <li>Poor the chocolate into the batter and mix thoroughly, it should be quite thick, and smooth throughout.</li>
        <li>Spread the batter into a parchment lined 9x13, nonstick pan, and bake for 35 minutes or until the large cracks have deloped, and the center has deflated.</li>
        <li>Allow the brownies to cool completely before removing from the pan, while fresh these brownies do not hold their shape. Allow to cool for 3 to 4 hours or preferably overnight before enjoying.</li>
