        <strong><em>This is an adaptation of the Chainbaker's brownie recipe to fit a 9x13 pan, and I am not a baker. Follow at your own risk.</em></strong>

    <p>   
        It makes simple, delicious, choclatey brownies. These are not diet food by any means but are easy and quick to make.
        I prefer them cold, as they get a gooey, almost fudge like center while keeping the satisfying crunch of good bread 
        elsewhere. I'd recommend chilling them overnight, but 2 to 3 hours should suffice. It is very important to let them 
        cool completely before attempting to remove from the pan as the internals of the brownie is essentially a liquid 
        straight out of the oven.
