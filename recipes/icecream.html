    <p>Adapted from <a href="https://amzn.to/2HARtgA">Bravetart: Iconic American Desserts</a> by Stella Parks I made this a few times, and the second, I didn't strain the chocolate as I didn't find the need to. Hence the photos in the post of straining both the chocolate, and the custard. The alcohol helps keep the ice cream from freezing too hard once churned. You can leave it out if you're avoiding alcohol, and check out some of my other strategies for keeping homemade ice cream softer. Or just remove the ice cream from the freezer 5 or so minutes in advance, to let it soften a bit.</p>

    <h5>Servings: 1 quart</h5>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <h5>For the chocolate base</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>3/4 cup (150g) sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup (3oz, 85g) unsweetened Dutch-process cocoa powder</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups (375ml) heavy cream</li>
        <li>3 ounces (85g, 1/2 cup) chopped bittersweet or semisweet chocolate</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chocolate or coffee-based liqueur, such as crème de cacao or Kalhuà</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>For the ice cream custard</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>5 large egg yolks</li>
        <li>1/4 cup (50g) sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup (250ml) whole milk</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon flaky sea salt or kosher salt (Diamond brand)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Make the chocolate base by whisking together in a medium saucepan, the 3/4 cup sugar and cocoa powder. Add the heavy cream and whisk until smooth. (It'll seem thick now, but will be fine when you cook it in the next step.) Add the chocolate.</li>
        <li>Heat the mixture over moderate heat, whisking constantly, until the mixture starts to bubble and boil. Scrape the chocolate base into a large bowl and set a mesh strainer over the top. Try to scrape as much of the chocolate out of the pan as possible, so you can use it in the next step. (Or you can use another saucepan.)</li>
        <li>To make the ice cream base, in a medium saucepan, whisk together the egg yolks, 1/4 cup sugar, milk, and salt. Set the pan over medium heat and stir with a silicone spatula constantly, until the custard base is warm. Continue to cook, stirring, until the custard starts to steam and thicken. Scrape the custard into the chocolate, add the vanilla and liqueur, and stir until smooth.</li>
        <li>Chill the mixture thoroughly, then freeze in your ice cream maker according to the manufacturer's instructions. (The mixture will be quite thick after chilling in the refrigerator, so you may want to beat it with a spatula to thin it out before churning.)</li>
    </ol>
